# Study Tracker
The Study Tracker is a simple Python-based tool designed to help students organize and manage their academic tasks. It allows users to record tasks, subjects, deadlines, and track completion status in an easy and efficient way. The goal of this project is to give students a lightweight, beginner-friendly system for managing schoolwork without needing complex apps or online accounts.

# Project Overview
This program serves as a basic task manager with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using tkinter. Students often struggle with keeping track of assignments across different subjects, and traditional planners can be messy or easily forgotten. Study Tracker solves this by offering a simple, structured way to list and monitor tasks using a clean command-line interface.

# Problem Statement
Many students forget deadlines or lose track of tasks because most available tools are either too complicated or require constant internet access. Physical planners can also be easily misplaced. This project solves that issue by providing a simple offline solution that saves tasks into a file so they are not lost. It’s especially useful for beginners learning Python and organization skills at the same time.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of Study Tracker are to:

- Provide a clear and simple way to record school tasks.
- Allow students to view, monitor, and manage deadlines.
- Give users the ability to mark tasks as completed.
- Encourage better study habits through organized task tracking.
- Offer a beginner-friendly example of list-based data management in Python.

# Features
- Add new tasks with subject and deadline
-  Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Save and load tasks using a file
- Deadline input with date and time
- Task type selection (Quiz, Assignment, etc.)
- Work type selection (Individual, Pair, Group)
- Add topics and notes
- View priority levels
- Track progress
- Search for assessments
- Display tasks in a clean graphical interface

# Planned Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
- Task name
- Subject
- Deadline
- Task selection for marking as done
- Task type
- Work type
- Topics
- Notes
- Priority level
- Search input

Outputs:
- A formatted list of tasks
- Task status (Done / Not Done)
- Confirmation messages after actions
- Updated task lists after changes
- Progress bar updates
- Priority display
- Task details popup
- Saved task confirmation

# Logic Plan
User Inputs: The user interacts through terminal prompts (e.g., entering task name, subject, etc.).

Task Storage: All task information is stored in dictionaries and saved into a JSON file.
- tasks
- subjects
- deadlines
- status

Processing: Using IF-ELSE logic, user choices control adding tasks, viewing tasks, or marking tasks as completed.

Outputs: The program prints formatted task lists, status updates, and confirmation messages. Users can continue managing tasks through a loop-based menu.

# METHODOLOGY
This repository has our Study Tracker project. All code, README, CHANGELOG, Project proposal are here. README and CHANGELOG are also here to track the updates.

The core features are:
- Add task (name, subject, deadline)
- View task
- Mark task as done
- Delete task
- Then loop

Technologies used:
- 1. Python (through onlineGDB) - easy and beginner friendly
  2. Github - free and it tracks what we committed and what we added new
 
Design Decisions:
- 1. Parallel list used for simplicity
  2. Tasks are temporary and not saved in any memory
 
Ethics:
- 1. Users privacy are RESPECTED
  2. Output is CLEAR and READABLE
